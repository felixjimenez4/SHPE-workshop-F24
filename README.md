## Installation
First, make sure to download NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en).

Follow the steps for installation, and you can check it is properly installed by typing `node -v`. This will be the way React will be able to run off our system, so make sure it is up to date.

## Set-up
Navigate to the directory you want to create the project either in the console or VScode.
The command that will create the project folder for us is `npx create-react-app` you can also name it by adding a name at the end like this `npx create-react-app [project name]`

The folder will take time to download and set up everything it needs in the folder, so you can take a small break while it sets up.

 * The `node module` folder is a storage folder that holds your React package along with other packages that might be installed as you work on your React project. The node module helps configure the design system of your React project. 
 * The `src` folder stores in all the files and components used in your react application ranging from the `App.js`, `index.js`, `App.css` just as seen in the image above.
 * The `package-lock.json` file locks the versions of dependencies your React project uses, and this helps in managing dependencies in your React project.

By typing `run dev` we can see the app by going in *localhost:8000*. We can make changes to the page by changing `App.js`.
